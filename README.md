# PassGen 
## A small but quick way to generate your own password that can't be cracked unless thee hacker wants to wait 3 millions years :) \
I'm still a beginner in python but I love making some quick and fun python projects like this one for example I had just learnt how to make a python number guesser game \
When I thought why not a password generator,sure there are loads of password generators and what I made isn't fabulous \
But at first I made something basic and with time I will try to make it better the more python I learn \
Hope you enjoy this project \
## Requirements for the program to work :
You will need Python 3 language installed, and that's all !
## Steps to download the repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/solitary8/ui-password_generator.git  
cd ui-password_generator

```
#### Now it should work,if it doesn't then submit an issue,thanks for using the tool !
