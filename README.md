# PasswGen 
## A small but quick way to generate your own password that can't be cracked unless thee hacker wants to wait 3 millions years :) \ 
I'm still a beginner in python but I love making some quick and fun python projects like this one for example I had just learnt how to make a python number guesser game \ 
When I thought why not a password generator,sure there are loads of password generators and what I made isn't fabulous \ 
But at first I made something basic and with time I will try to make it better the more python I learn \ 
Hope you enjoy this project
